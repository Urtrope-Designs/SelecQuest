# SelecQuest
Crack open your phone, roll up your hero, and conquer the Omniverse. You’ll soon find yourself on a tireless quest for loot, renown, and social leverage. But the game does all the work for you!

Your hero’s tasks proceed infinitely, with the type of task - and the fruits of your labor - determined by your only input: the current Adventuring Mode!

### Loot Mode
Tasks will involve fighting monsters or crawling dungeons, and will net you some baller loot. You can only carry so much loot at a time though, before your encumbrance maxes out and you have to head back to civilization to capitalize all that loot into gold. Acquire enough sweet monies, and you’ll find yourself with upgraded gear! Stick with this Adventuring Mode too long and you’ll saturate the market, decimating not only the return you get for your loot, but also your XP and Story progress.

### Trial Mode
Dueling or undertaking trials will net you trophies, which will be converted to renown once you tire of the strain and regale any tavern-goer within earshot with tales of your daring deeds. Increase your renown to improve your standing within the Omniverse’s authoritative Ranking Systems, and improve your likelihood of winning various championships. Champions are occasionally lavished with rad accolades. Stay in Trial Mode too long though, and the people will no longer believe you live up to the hype, crippling your progress in renown, XP, and Storyline, and potentially reducing your rankings.

### Quest Mode
Undertake endless quests to build your reputation once your little book of quests is full. The higher your reputation, the more likely you are to catch the attention if the various adventurers guilds and associations. Keep at it to earn memberships and even offices within these groups.
